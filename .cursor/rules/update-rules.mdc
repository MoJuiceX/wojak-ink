# Wojak Ink Project Rules

## Project Context
This is a Windows 98-style NFT showcase app for Chia blockchain, gifted from Bullish0xCrypto to Abit. It's built with React, Vite, and uses Docker for development.

## Critical Rules

### 1. Mac-Focused Development
- **ALWAYS** use Mac Terminal commands (not Windows PowerShell/CMD)
- Use `lsof` instead of `netstat` for port checking
- Use forward slashes (/) in file paths
- Reference "Terminal" not "PowerShell" or "Command Prompt"
- Use Cmd key (not Ctrl) for keyboard shortcuts
- Include Homebrew installation when relevant
- Reference Docker Desktop for Mac (not Docker for Windows)

### 2. README Maintenance
- **MUST** update README.md when:
  - Adding new features
  - Changing dependencies
  - Modifying Docker setup
  - Changing build/deployment
  - Adding configuration
- Follow README_WORKFLOW.md guidelines
- Use README_UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md for quick reference
- Test all README commands on Mac before committing
- Keep README in sync with codebase at all times

### 3. Tone & Style
- Maintain Tang Gang vibes (casual, meme-friendly, supportive)
- Keep beginner-friendly explanations (Abit is new to development)
- Use enthusiastic but professional tone
- Reference Bullish0xCrypto and Tang Gang community
- Balance technical accuracy with personality

### 4. Docker Support
- Document Docker setup when adding Docker features
- Include both standard and Docker development options
- Test docker-compose commands on Mac
- Update Docker section in README when changes are made

### 5. Code Quality
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use React 19 best practices
- Maintain Windows 98 UI consistency (98.css)
- Test on Mac before committing
- Check browser console for errors

### 6. File Structure
- Keep components organized in `src/components/`
- Windows in `src/components/windows/`
- Services in `src/services/`
- Utils in `src/utils/`
- Update project structure in README when adding files

## When Adding Features

1. Implement the feature
2. Test on Mac
3. Update README.md immediately:
   - Add to Features section
   - Add usage instructions
   - Update relevant sections
   - Add to troubleshooting if needed
4. Verify README instructions work
5. Commit both code and README changes together

## When Modifying Dependencies

1. Update package.json
2. Run `npm install`
3. Test everything works
4. Update README.md:
   - Prerequisites section
   - Installation section
   - Troubleshooting if issues arise
5. Update README_UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md if new patterns emerge

## Docker Changes

1. Update Docker files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
2. Test Docker setup on Mac
3. Update README.md:
   - Running Locally section (Docker option)
   - Docker Setup section
   - Prerequisites (Docker Desktop)
4. Verify all Docker commands work

## Code Examples

Always provide Mac-compatible examples:
```bash
# ✅ Good (Mac)
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
cd ~/projects/wojak-ink

# ❌ Bad (Windows)
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
cd C:\projects\wojak-ink
```

## Remember

- README is part of the codebase - update it with every change
- Test everything on Mac
- Keep it beginner-friendly
- Maintain Tang Gang energy
- Document as you go, don't wait
